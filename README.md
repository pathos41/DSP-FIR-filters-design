# DSP-FIR-filters-design
FIR filter design using different methods:
1. Window functions: Hamming, Blackman, Hanning, Kaiser and rectangular window functions.
2. Least-square minimax.
3. Equiripple (PM and Remez).
In order to counter the Gibbs phenomenon, a newly-constructed window function is tested, in comparison with the Hamming window.
